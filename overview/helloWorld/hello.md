# ðŸ‘‹ Hello (2 mins)

Hey there, and welcome to our Hello World Journey! I'm Martin, DevRel at iExec,
and I'm thrilled to guide you through the exciting world of confidential
computing and data privacy.

I'm a developer too, and I know you're probably eager to jump straight into the
code. Trust me, I'll keep it short and focus on the main concepts. Feel free to
click on the highlighted words if you want to dive deeper into specific topics.

As your cool guide, I'll sum up what we'll learn during this quick journey. You
can definitely achieve this during a hackathonâ€”it takes approximately 30 minutes
for all 4 chapters.
