# 🧐 iExec Overview

> Reading 🕒 4 mins

Great, intro is done, now let's dive into the key concepts. What are the main
components of the iExec stack?

## 👷 What Problem Does iExec Solve?

Let's keep it simple! Imagine you have some valuable data that you want to use or share, but you need to keep it private. This is where iExec comes in.

### 🔒 The Two Key Parts

#### 1. Protected Data
- Your sensitive data is encrypted and stored safely
- Only you control who can access it
- Perfect for private information like research data, business analytics, or personal records

#### 2. iExec Apps
- Special applications that can work with your protected data
- Run in secure environments (called TEEs) that keep your data private
- Process your data without exposing it to anyone

### 🤝 How They Work Together

Think of it like a secure room:
- Your protected data can only be "opened" inside this room
- Only approved apps can enter the room
- Everything that happens inside stays private
- You control who gets access

### 💡 What You Can Build

With iExec, you can create applications that:
- Process sensitive data securely
- Share data while keeping it private
- Monetize data without exposing it
- Run confidential computations

It's that simple! Protected data + secure apps = private, useful computations. Ready to build something amazing?

## 🧩 The Key Features

The **iExec protocol** unlock some amazing features like:

### 🔑 Confidential Computing

Confidential computing ensures that your sensitive data remains private and
secure during processing (more technical details about confidential computing
with
[Intel SGX Enclave](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/overview-of-intel-sgx-enclave-637284.pdf)).
This is crucial because it allows you to run computations on sensitive data,
without exposing it to any external threats.

### 🔑 Privacy and User Choice

iExec puts **control** back in your hands. With iExec, you decide what data is
shared, with whom, and for what purpose. As an environmental scientist, you can
securely compute or share your findings and datasets with collaborators without
worrying about unauthorized access.

### 🔑 Monetize Your data

One of the coolest features is that our technology allows you to monetize your
digital assets. For example, if you have a bunch of sensitive data, you can
monetize it by lending it for computing or selling it directly.

## 🧩 Key takeaways

- **iExec Protocol** is the foundation of our stack, combining TEE and
  blockchain to enable confidential computing and data management.
- **Confidential computing** is the magic that happens inside the TEE, ensuring
  that your sensitive data remains private and secure during processing.

## 💫The Next steps

Quick wrap up: Our protocol, composed of **TEE and Blockchain**, enables key
features such as **confidential computing, data management, and monetization**
and, teasing you with the next chapter, built on top of the protocol, we have
our **Developer’s Tools**.

They capture the essence and power of confidential computing and blockchain
technology, abstracting away the complexity. Drum roll 🥁 ... the devtool we are
going to discover is **DataProtector**.🚀
