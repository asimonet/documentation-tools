# 👋 Hello (2 mins)

Hey there, and welcome to our Hello World Journey! I'm Martin, DevRel at iExec,
and I'm thrilled to guide you through the exciting world of confidential
computing and data privacy.

I'm a developer too, and I know you're probably eager to jump straight into the
code. Trust me, I'll keep it short and focus on the main concepts. Feel free to
click on the highlighted words if you want to dive deeper into specific topics.

As your cool guide, I'll sum up what we'll learn during this quick journey. You
can definitely achieve this during a hackathon—it takes approximately 30 minutes
for all 5 chapters.

## 🤓 What will you learn during this journey?

### **Chapter 1:** iExec Stack Overview

Through a use case, we'll introduce you to the **iExec stack** and its main key
components.

### **Chapter 2:** Your Data, Your Rules

You'll learn how to protect and manage your data with our developer tool.

### **Chapter 3:** Compute Data

We'll show you how to build, deploy and run an iExec application and process
your protected data.

### **Chapter 4:** Monetize Your Data

We'll show you all the monetization features you can use with your protected
data.

### **Secret Chapter:** Pssst...

If you’ve made it through every chapter, protected your data, and run an iExec
application, a little surprise awaits you! 🌟 What could it be? Only one way to
find out! …okay, you can click directly on Secret Chapter, but it’s not as fun
😉

## 😬 **OMFG so many new words !!! Please a glossary**

In this journey, we'll use some specific terms related to confidential computing
or other concepts. Open a new tab and keep it open here 😉 Here is our shiny
glossary: [glossary](https://protocol.docs.iex.ec/help/glossary)
