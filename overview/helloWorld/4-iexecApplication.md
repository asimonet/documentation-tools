# Build Your iDapp

This guide will help you set up, test, run, and deploy your iDapp using the
`idapp-cli` tool. Follow the instructions carefully for a smooth development
experience.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed on your
system:

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 18 or higher
- [**NPM**](https://docs.npmjs.com/) (Node.js package manager)
- [**Docker**](https://hub.docker.com/) have docker on your computer
- [**DockerHub**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) have a dockerhub
  account

## Installation

First, you need to install the `idapp-cli` package. Open your terminal and run
the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/idapp.git
cd idapp/cli
npm ci
npm i -g .
```

## Initialize Framework

To initialize the working directory for developing your iDapp, use the
`idapp init` command. This command sets up the necessary project structure and
files.

```sh
idapp init
```

You will be prompted with the following message:

```
 ___ ____    _    ____  ____
 |_ _|  _ \  / \  |  _ \|  _ \
  | || | | |/ _ \ | |_) | |_) |
  | || |_| / ___ \|  __/|  __/
 |___|____/_/   \_\_|   |_|

? A new project will be created in the current directory. Do you want to continue? Yes
? What is the name of your project? develop-my-idapp
? Which language do you want to use to build your iDapp? JavaScript
? Would you like to access a protected data inside your iDapp? (Y/n)
```

:::tip

Answer `no` to the last question
`? Would you like to access protected data inside your iDapp?`. We will cover
integrating protected data into your iDapp later.

:::

A new folder was created, it contains a very simple Node.js application, with
the main code being located in `app.js`.

## Test Your iDapp

To test your iDapp, use the `idapp test` command. This command will invoke your
locally installed Node.js and run the `app.js` file.

### Using Parameters

You can pass input parameters to your iDapp using the `--param` option. This
allows you to provide necessary inputs during runtime.

```sh
idapp test --param <your-input>
```

### Using Docker

In the end, an iDapp will be run by an iExec worker which needs a Docker image
as input. So for a more realistic test, you can run your iDapp using your local
Docker daemon.

```sh
idapp run --docker
```

## Deploy Your iDapp

Deploy your iDapp on the iExec protocol.

```sh
idapp deploy
```

Now you can run your application using:

```sh
idapp run <your-idapp-address>
```

If you want, you can integrate protected data into your iDapp to process private
data. To do that, you need to start this tutorial again and answer `y` to the
question `? Would you like to access protected data inside your iDapp?`.

## ðŸ§© Grant Access to Your iDapp

What do you mean by "grant access"?, you may ask. Well, it's simple. When you
protect your data, you can authorize users and specific applications to access
it. This is where you grant access to your iDapp. Like that an authorized user
will be able to use an authorized app to access your protected data and compute
it.

Authorize your iExec Application to access your protected data using the button
below.here is a simple diagram to explain the process:
