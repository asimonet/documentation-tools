# Getting Started with iExec: Confidential Computing

## Overview

Welcome to iExec's confidential computing platform. This guide introduces you to
the core concepts of confidential computing and how iExec enables secure,
private computation in a decentralized environment.

## What is Confidential Computing?

Confidential computing represents a paradigm shift in data processing, where
sensitive data remains encrypted and protected even during computation. iExec
leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to ensure:

- Data privacy throughout the entire computation lifecycle
- Secure execution in untrusted environments
- Verifiable results with cryptographic guarantees

## Key Components

### TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)

TEEs provide hardware-based isolation for your applications, ensuring:

- Memory encryption
- Code integrity
- Runtime protection
- Attestation capabilities

### Protected Data

Your sensitive information remains encrypted and accessible only within the
secure TEE environment. This includes:

- Input data
- Application logic
- Computation results

## Why Choose iExec?
