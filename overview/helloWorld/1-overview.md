## 👨‍💻 Building privacy-first dApps with iExec

<p>Imagine you're building a decentralized application (dApp) that needs to <strong> handle sensitive user data </strong>, for example:</p>
<div class="use-case-card">
  <div class="examples-list">
    <div class="example-item">
      <span class="example-icon">🏥</span>
      <span>A healthcare app processing confidential patient records</span>
    </div>
    <div class="example-item">
      <span class="example-icon">💰</span>
      <span>A financial app handling transaction data</span>
    </div>
    <div class="example-item">
      <span class="example-icon">🔬</span>
      <span>A research platform working with private datasets</span>
    </div>
    <div class="example-item">
      <span class="example-icon">🤖</span>
      <span>An AI model training on sensitive data</span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="requirements-list">
    <p><strong>You'll need a way to:</strong></p>
    <div class="requirement-item">
      <span class="req-icon">🔒</span>
      <span>Keep the data confidential</span>

      <span>Control who can access it</span>

      <span>Process it securely</span>

<div class="solution-note">
  <p>This is where <span class="highlight">iExec</span> comes in! We provide tools to easily add <span class="highlight">privacy features</span> to your applications.</p>
</div>

## 👷 What do we solve?

Unlike traditional security, iExec protects and encrypts your data throughout
its entire lifecycle, during storage, transfer, and even while **being processed
by applications.**

<div class="solution-note">
  <p>Our technology allows users to control the <span class="highlight">ownership</span>,
<span class="highlight">confidentiality</span>, and <span class="highlight">monetization</span> of their data and digital assets within the <span class="highlight">Web3</span> ecosystem.</p>
</div>

### 🔒 The three key elements

iExec combines three fundamental elements that work together seamlessly:

#### 1. Protect your data with our devtool DataProtector

- Your sensitive data is encrypted and stored safely
- Only you control when and who can access it
- Perfect for private information like research data, business analytics, or
  personal records

#### 2. Compute data with iExec apps running in secure environment

- Special applications that can work with protected data
- Run in secure environments (called TEEs) that keep your data private
- Process data without exposing sensitive information

#### 3. Set the rules with the blockchain layer

- Enables tokenization of data
- Regain ownership of your data
- Provides transparent governance rules for data access

<div class="solution-note">
  <p>By merging <span class="highlight">blockchain technology</span> with <span class="highlight">confidential computing</span>, we've pioneered <span class="highlight">DeCC</span> (Decentralized Confidential Computing) to take <span class="highlight">privacy</span> and <span class="highlight">security</span> to the next level in <span class="highlight">Web3</span> ecosystems.</p>
</div>

### 🤝 Why we talk about privacy (explained to your grandma)

Imagine a secure room (called a TEE Where confidential computing happens) where
all activities remain completely safe and private, like a bank vault for data.

The protect data you you created with DataProtector can only be accessed inside
this secure room. Only approved iExec Apps can enter and work with your data
there.

You stay in control writing rules in an immutable notebook that determine who
can access your data and when. your data and when.

## 🔍 Building your first privacy-preserving dApp

Let's meet Bob and Alice to understand how iExec enables privacy-preserving
applications:

### 1. Meet Bob: the dApp developer 👨‍💻

Bob is building a decentralized application that leverages iExec's technology.
His platform consists of:

- A user-friendly frontend interface
- Built-in DataProtector features for securing user data and managing access
- An iExec App that can process protected data (apply algorithms, sharing,
  monetize it, etc.)

### 2. Meet Alice: the dApp user 👩‍💼

When using Bob's platform, Alice can:

- Protect her data using the platform's DataProtector feature
- Maintain full control over who can access her protected data
- Authorize specific iExec Apps and persons like Bob to use her data in a secure
  environment

Depending on the dApp's use case, Alice could:

- Apply algorithms to her data and get results confidentially
- Share her data with other users privately (and get paid for it)
- Train AI models on her data and get predictions confidentially
- Ask questions to AI models about her data and get answers confidentially

And many other use cases...
