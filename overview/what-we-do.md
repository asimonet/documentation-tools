# ðŸ’¡ What we do

iExec offers a unique and innovative solution to protect and grow the value of your digital estate\*. Its decentralized nature, built-in blockchain protocol, and support for cutting-edge cryptographic technologies make it an ideal choice for individuals and organizations seeking to optimize their computing resources while prioritizing security and privacy.

If you are a developer interested in **privacy**, **ownership**, and **monetization**, iExec is the perfect platform for you.

iExec offers developers the ability to build and deploy their decentralized applications. This means that data is stored on a decentralized network, ensuring that they are protected from any unauthorized access. Additionally, iExec uses advanced **confidential computing** techniques to ensure that data remain secure and private even when processed on untrusted remote servers. That guarantees that data is protected from unauthorized access and tampering, even if the underlying hardware or operating system is compromised. Thus, iExec technology is built following a privacy-by-design principle, which guarantees that no one can access or copy usersâ€™ and developersâ€™ data unless explicitly granted by their respective owners.

iExec offers developers the ability to retain ownership of their applications and data. This is because iExec is a decentralized platform leveraging **Ethereum** blockchain technology. Access control rules are stored in blockchain smart contracts and therefore cannot be modified by anyone. This way, data owners can grant or revoke access to their data as needed. You retain complete control over your data and applications, ensuring that you have complete ownership and control&#x20;

Finally, iExec offers developers the ability to **monetize their applications and data**. Thanks to iExec, developers can easily rent their applications following a simple pay-per-task model and allow their users to monetize the usage of their own data. Additionally, iExec offers developers the ability to earn rewards for sharing their computing resources with the network.

By combining these methods, iExec aims to provide the technology for developers to **build Web3 applications** that allow users to store, process, and share their data while maintaining control over its usage and privacy.

_\*digital estate represents every digital asset that you own and can create value from. This can be from an email address to an entire application._
