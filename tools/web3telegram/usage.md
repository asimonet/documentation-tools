## Create your protected data

To create a Telegram protected data:

- Select Telegram as the type.

- Enter your chat ID in the designated field.

- Name your protected data for easy identification.


## Authorizing Users

To authorize users to send you messages using the bot:

- Click on your protected data.

- Choose "Authorize New User".

- Define the user's Ethereum address and specify how many Telegram messages they can send you.

After creating your protected data, it's important to initiate a conversation with the bot. This action authorizes the bot to send messages within that specific conversation. Without this step, you will be unable to receive messages.

## How to get your chat ID 

To retrieve your chat ID, send a message to the bot @getmyid_bot.

The bot will reply with your chat ID. This ID is unique to each conversation, whether itâ€™s a private message or a group chat.

Once you've created a protected data, the bot will only be able to send messages to the specific conversation that matchs the chat ID.

All messages from Web3Telegram, regardless of the sender, will arrive in this same conversation, depending on the chat ID. You can easily and at any time leave this conversation.

## Group Chat ID

The chat ID is not unique to private messages on Telegram, but it also applies to groups.

To get the chat ID of a group, simply add the bot to the group, and it will provide the group's chat ID upon joining. You also need to add the Web3Telegram bot to let him send messages.
