# Data sharing - Collection methods

Under the Data Sharing module, everything starts with a collection.  
A collection is a way to group your protected data. It's a required step before choosing
how you would like to distribute your protected data.

And yes, you can have multiple collections.

Inside a collection, your protected data can be:
 - Shared for free (equivalent to renting with a price of 0)
 - Rented
 - Included in a subscription bundle
 - Sold
 - And even: not available for sharing
