## DataProtector Core

**Overview**: DataProtector simplifies secure data management, offering users essential tools for protecting, managing, and sharing their data effectively. The platform consists of two key modules: DataProtectorCore and DataProtectorSharing.

DataProtectorCore: As the foundational component of DataProtector, DataProtectorCore provides essential functionalities for data protection. Users can encrypt their data and record ownership on a smart contract, ensuring confidentiality and traceability. Granting access to authorized applications is streamlined, facilitating secure data management.

With DataProtectorCore, you can grant access to your protected data to a specific user.

- You need to know the user's Ethereum address.
- You'll have to sign a transaction at the moment you grant the access.
- You define a number of times the user can access the data.

## DataProtector Sharing

Building upon DataProtectorCore, DataProtectorSharing introduces advanced features for data sharing and ownership transfer. Users can securely transfer ownership of protected data, enabling collaboration and potential monetization opportunities. This module empowers users to share and manage their data securely, fostering innovation and collaboration in the digital realm.

With DataProtector Sharing, you can distribute your protected data to a wider audience.

- You don't need to know the user's Ethereum address.
- You don't need to sign a transaction at the moment of distribution (but the user who wants to access your content will).
- Any user can access your content as long as they comply with your distribution and monetization choices.
