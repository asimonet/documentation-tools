# Data sharing - Collection methods

Under the Data Sharing module, everything starts with a collection.  
A collection is a way to **group your protected data**. It's a required step
before choosing how you would like to distribute your protected data.

And yes, you can have **multiple collections**.

Inside a collection, a protected data can be in a number of different states:

- **Not distributed**, ie. only the collection's owner can see it
- **For free** (same as "for rent" with a price of 0)
- **For rent** (a price and a duration)
- Included in the **subscription bundle**
- For rent AND included in the collection subscription bundle
- **For sale**
